# Welcome!
## Me
I'm Bill Minear - a computer infrastructure engineer and enthusiast. I enjoy
learning about, building, maintaining, automating, and securing network, 
application, and service infrastructure (*whew!*). I also enjoy teaching
some of these topics and sharing things that I've learned with other people.

Thanks for stopping by.  
I hope you have a great day!

## My Repos
#### [Homelab Resources](https://github.com/billminear/homelab_resources)
My personal practice area. I contribute when I can. IaC files,
documentation, scripts, etc. I use these to build and maintain my homelab.
I share them because it's fun to make them and maybe someone else will find
value in using or looking at them.
